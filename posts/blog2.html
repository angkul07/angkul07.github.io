    <h2>What I Did This Summer:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Classic ML from CS229. Only 11 lectures because I realized that it is an outdated course.</li>
        <li>Doing CS231n. I'm going to complete the course. I have completed four lectures. It has the best teacher.</li>
        <li>Built Micrograd.</li>
        <li>Tried competitive programming but I was bored.</li>
        <li>Tried DSA but again dumped it because I was bored.</li>
        <li>Built a basic version of a web browser(not completed) by following this tutorial <a href="https://browser.engineering/index.html">book</a></li>
        <li>Wrote ML algorithms from scratch and built some projects.</li>
        <li>Did a lot of 16-hour code sessions. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/dnbt777">dnbt</a>.</li>
        <li>Wow, can't believe it, but I completed 50 days of ML.</li>
        <li>Started posting on Twitter frequently. My first intention was to network and document my journey, but then I enjoyed the interaction there and loved it. Two blogs that were helpful for me and inspired me to post more: <a href="https://dejavucoder.substack.com/p/guide-to-this-bird-app">Twitter Guide</a> and <a href="https://dejavucoder.substack.com/p/what-you-post-determines-your-tribe">Posting Guide</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p></p>
    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Posting more tech posts on Twitter and some blogs. In short, becoming more knowledgeable.</li>
        <li>Implementing research papers.</li>
        <li>Doing a lot of 16-hour code sessions.</li>
        <li>Taking books more seriously and relying on them more for learning.</li>
        <li>Building a lot of projects.</li>
        <li>Finishing the "Zero to Hero" at least once.</li>
        <li>Now I guess it's time to learn PyTorch.</li>
        <li>Learn some basic frontend and backend. These are kinda necessary these days.</li>
        <li>DSA. Need to start doing it again.</li>
        <li>my health take a toll. so gonna start workout soon</li>
        <li><strong>Medium Priority:</strong> Do some C and build some projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Priority:</strong> Continue working on the web browser.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p></p>
    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Just post and interact with people. Don't worry. We post.</li>
        <li>Message everyone like they are your friend. Be respectful and fun. People are ready to help you, but you have to help yourself first.</li>
        <li>Read, read, read.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to accept your mistakes and shortcomings. I accept them frequently in tweets. Chill.</li>
        <li>Don't fall for the shining object phenomenon. Focus on things that are important.</li>
        <li>Just keep doing the bit, anon</li>
    </ul>
